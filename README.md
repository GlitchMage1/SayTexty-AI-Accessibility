# SayTexty 🎙️🖥️  
An AI-focused web application designed to transform spoken audio into text and summaries, with a strong emphasis on accessibility, clarity, and user experience.

⚠️ **Project Status: UI/UX & Frontend completed — backend logic in progress**  
At this stage, the project focuses on interface design and frontend structure. Core features such as audio recording, live transcription, and AI processing are currently under active development.

---

## 🎨 Current Development Stage
The current version of SayTexty represents a **fully designed and structured frontend**, including layouts, interaction flows, and visual modes.

This stage was intentionally developed first to:
- Define a clear user experience
- Validate interface logic before backend integration
- Build a scalable foundation for future features

---

## 📸 Project Preview
UI screenshots, design mockups, and short interface demos will be added soon.

> *Note: Current previews focus on design and interaction flow rather than functional recording or transcription.*

---

## 🌍 Live Demo
🚧 **Not deployed yet**

Deployment is planned after backend integration and stabilization of core features.  
Target platforms: **Render / Railway**.
